### Real-time Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)

Trying to build a simple real-time ASR system using VAD and NeMo Parakeet models.

A python project which implements a real-time automatic speech recognition (ASR) system using voice activity detection (VAD) and NVIDIA's NeMo Parakeet models. The system captures audio input, detects speech segments, and transcribes them into text in real-time.
